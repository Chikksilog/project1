            <p>
                Hi! I'm Jayzee James E. Flores, a college student in University of Nueva Caceres currently taking Bachelor of 
                Science in Information Technology. I've been living in this world for two decades and a year now. I was born on September 28, 2003 at Chinese General Hospital, Manila, Blumentrit. I have two brothers and a half-sister.
                I play various games like Valorant, MInecraft, Clash of Clans, and Mobile Legends. I am Currently a Sangguniang Kabataan Kagawad in my Baranggay.
                I am a bit fond of technology and can mostly adapt in order for me to understand them. I do physical Hobbies too Like Basketall, Cycling, Running,
                etc. I like to cook food and mostly prefer home cooked foods. I have a cat named Cinnamon. My favourite drinks are Strawberry and matcha flavored drinks.
                I usually ride my motorcyle to go to school. I enjoy learning new technologies and applying them to solve real-world problems.
                I have a bit of knowledge on HTML, CSS, Java, and C++. My goal is to graduate and get a job.
